## Personal Thoughts
### (00) Intro to the React Ecosystem
Tyler does a good job of articulating what React.js is.

In addition, he explains the purpose of each necessary dependency along with what it does.


### (01) Setting up your first React component with NPM, Babel, and Webpack
Albeit the hello-world example in this framework is not particularily simple, the solution gives the user a solid foundation for moving forward with creating a web application.

I was geniuenly surpised at how lightweight the node web server and React.js application are.
