Talk Python To Me - Michael Kennedy's Courses


## Courses Location
https://talkpython.fm/


## Personal Thoughts
I have been a professional Python developer since June of 2015.

Prior to this time, a majority of my experience was Java based (professional and college).
<br />
This repository is intended to be a corpus of TalkPython.fm courses I have purchased and went through.

As I dove into the Python space, I wanted to find a medium in which to keep pulse on the Python community.
I came across the Talk Python To Me podcast by typing 'python' in my Android podcast application, Pocket 
Cast.

After listening to a majority of Michael's podcasts, I began to look into his training courses.
These courses have set a new level of expectation from online courses/training.
